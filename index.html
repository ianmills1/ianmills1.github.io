          <h1 class="display-none" id="scroll1">About Me</h1>
          <p class="lead display-none">Hello, my name is Ian Mills and I am currently looking for a new job in the tech field. In 2019 I graduated
              Eleven Fifty Academy's immersive .NET program. I worked as a software developer for a year until I had to step away to help with family
              care as COVID surged. After that I actually went back to Eleven Fifty to work as a teaching assistant for their .NET program. I absolutely
              loved that job. Helping students learn the material and work toward their dreams in the tech field was incredibly rewarding. Unfortunately, 
              earlier this year Eleven Fifty let teaching assistants go due to budget constraints and here I am looking for a new opportunity.</p><br>
              
          <p> I feel I should briefly touch on my experience before Eleven Fifty. I graduated from DePauw University with a bachelor's degree in economics.
              I found myself working for a school in their financial aid department until they closed in late 2018. I never felt fully challenged in that
              job which is partly why I went to Eleven Fifty to learn more demanding skills. However, that job was still incredibly valuable. As my 
              first job after college I learned all the necessary skills of how to operate in a corporate environment. I loved working with my team and 
              helping all the students out.</p><br>
              
          <p> With every job I've held the most rewarding aspects have always been the teamwork and working with clients. I really enjoy the outward
              facing roles and helping clients out. With my financial aid job that involved helping students through the confusing world of financial aid 
              and with any questions they had through their academic career. With my software development job I most enjoyed working with the sales team
              to present pitches to prospective clients. I also really enjoyed leading training sessions for clients to teach their employees about the
              software they'd be using. Honestly I probably enjoyed the actual development part of the job the least which is why I'm looking to pivot away
              from a full-time development job but still remain in the tech field in a support role. As I mentioned above, as a teaching assistant with
              Eleven Fifty I loved working with all the students to help them learn. Development is an incredibly challenging skill to learn so anything I
              could do to help students felt very rewarding.</p><br>
              
          <p> In my next role I hope to continue doing what I loved most about my old jobs. I feel my most valuable skills are my communication and ability
              to work closely with clients and teammates. I bring a strong sense of organization and dedication to the team to work together to achieve
              our goals. I'm looking forward to the next chapter of a challenging and rewarding career.</p><br>
              
          <p> The rest of the portfolio contains a few of the projects I completed at Eleven Fifty to show what we learned. Thanks!</p><br>
